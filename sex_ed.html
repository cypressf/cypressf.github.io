            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            Studies have been done on the efficacy of abstinence-only sex education
            that conclude that abstinence-only sex ed has no effect on teen pregnancy
            rates. Additionally, some studies have concluded that comprehensive sex
            ed reduces the rates of teen pregnancy.<sup><a href="#abst_only">[1]</a></sup> I would like to be able to quantify
            the effect of sex ed on teen pregnancy, or unwanted pregnancy. Thus, I
            enter this project with the goal of investigating the effects of abstinence-only
            sex education and comprehensive sex education on pregnancy rates, unwanted
            pregnancy rates, and age of first pregnancy for young adults and teens.
            I use the most recent data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG),
            Cycle 7, 2006-2010.<sup><a href="#NSFG">[2]</a></sup>

            Summary of Data
        </h2>
        <p>
            The NSFG data from Cycle 7 contains data from surveys conducted from 2006-2010.
            The surveys contain responses from 12279 women but out of the women surveyed,
            only those with age &#x2264; 24 years were asked about sex ed history, so I only
            include women under 25 in my study. In total there are 4395 women under
            25 years of age who had a total of 2405 pregnancies.

            Explorations:
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am interested in how sex education affects the probability of having
            an unwanted pregnancy, as well as the age at which a woman first gets pregnant,
            and how many pregnancies a woman has total. For the following explorations,
            I group women into four categories:
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>
                Women who had sex ed on how to use birth control (2914 total)
            </li>
            <li>
                Women who did not have sex ed on how to use birth control (1165 total)
            </li>
            <li>
                (subset of #2) Women who did not have sex ed on how to use birth control
                and did have sex ed on how to say no to sex (commonly known as abstinence
                only education). (745 total)
            </li>
            <li>
                Women who had sex ed on sexually transmitted diseases. (3694 total)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            To be clear, the four categories are not mutually exclusive. Women who
            had sex ed on how to use birth control includes some women who had sex
            ed on sexually transmitted diseases and visa versa. Women who had abstinence
            only education is a subset of category 2. Additionally, in each category,
            I exclude data from women who reported having intercourse with a male before
            first having sex education. I do this because the sex ed that these women
            had could potentially have come after their first pregnancy, in which case,
            it is impossible to draw conclusions as to how the sex ed affected their
            pregnancy.

            Investigating Unwanted Pregnancies
        </h3>
        <p>
            In order to see how birth control relates to unwanted pregnancies, I look
            at the ratio of unwanted pregnancies to total pregnancies for all four
            groups of women. If a woman had no pregnancies, I did not include them
            in the analysis. The ratio corresponds to percentage of unwanted births.
            A ratio of 1.0 means all the births the woman had were unwanted. A ratio
            of 0.0 means all of the births the woman had were wanted. Using this number,
            I hope to get a glimpse into how well a woman was able control when she
            got pregnant (under the assumption that a woman would not choose to get
            pregnant if a she did not want a pregnancy at the time).

        <p>
            The difference between the wantedness ratios for the four groups is small,
            and the standard deviations are high in comparison to the mean. For example,
            if I define a null hypothesis to be that the observed difference between
            the distributions of the wantedness of pregnancies under the "birth control"
            and "no birth control" groups is due to chance, I get a p-value of 0.57.
            This indicates that different types (or lack) of sex education does not
            show a correlation with percentage of unwanted births. This is unexpected
            because I assumed I would see a moderate correlation between sex ed and
            wantedness of births. If a woman was taught about birth control in sex
            ed, for example, I assumed she would be more likely to control her pregnancies,
            and thus, have fewer unwanted pregnancies.
        </p>
        <h3 id="wantedness">
            Is the wantedness of pregnancies a relevant statistic?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Based on the previous exploration, I saw that testing a difference in
            means between the wantedness of pregnancies for women with and without
            birth control education revealed a high p-value, and therefore is considered
            statistically insignificant. It is still possible, however, that the standard
            deviations are statistically significant. Based on the table in the previous
            section, it looks like they are similar, but it doesn't hurt to test them
            anyway. In order to do so, I need to run a chi-square test.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            For the chi-square test, I will use two cells: <em>wanted pregnancies</em> and <em>unwanted
            pregnancies</em>. Based on the pregnancy pool, I get the following expected
            and observed values for women who had birth control education and women
            who did not have birth control education.

            Investigating Number of Pregnancies
        </h3>
        <p>
            Although in the first investigation we see that a woman is not less likely
            to have unwanted pregnancies if she has birth control sex ed, I am not
            accounting for a certain case: a woman may get pregnant unintentionally,
            but not care one way or the other. There is a difference between an <em>unwanted</em> pregnancy,
            and an <em>unintentional</em> pregnancy. The survey does not include data on whether
            or not pregnancies were intentional and it would be impossible to infer
            through other variables. In order to account for this lack of information,
            I will look at the total number of pregnancies for each woman. My assumption
            is that a woman who has more unintentional pregnancies will have more pregnancies
            on average than a woman who has only intentional pregnancies (assuming
            the average woman intends to have the same number of pregnancies). A higher
            number of pregnancies, for one of the four groups, would therefore indicate
            a higher number of unintentional pregnancies for that group.

            Investigating Age of First Pregnancy
        </h3>
        <p>
            An often cited statistic when looking at sex ed is the "teen pregnancy
            rate." I think the teen pregnancy rate is relevant, but I think that it
            is contrived to group ages into "teens" and "adults." By only looking at
            teen pregnancy rates, studies ignore the distribution of ages at which
            women first become pregnant. Therefore, I wish to generalize this statistic
            into <em>age at conception of first pregnancy</em>. A younger mean age at first
            conception in a certain group indicates women in that group are using less
            protection, or having intercourse at an earlier age than those of other
            groups. A higher mean age at first conception indicates women in that group
            are using more protection, or having intercourse at a later age.

            Noticeably, the mean age of pregnancy given that a woman had sex ed about
            birth control is about a year higher than the mean age of pregnancy given
            that a woman had no sex ed about birth control. In addition, the mean age
            of pregnancy given that a woman had abstinence only education is very similar
            to the mean age of pregnancy for everyone. The standard deviation of all
            four cases is around 2 years. There seems to be a relationship between
            birth control sex ed and age of first conception. Based on the means it
            seems as if birth control education increases the age at first pregnancy,
            while abstinence only education does not have a significant effect on the
            age at first pregnancy. To further investigate this, I present a plot of
            the CDF of the age at first conception for the four groups:

            on birth control, women who had abstinence only education, and women who
            had sex education on STDs. The CDF of women who had sex education on birth
            control is shifted to the right, indicating a higher age at first conception
            than the other groups.

        <p>
            Out of the four groups, the two groups "birth control ed" and "no birth
            control ed," are the only two that are mutually exclusive and collectively
            exhaustive. The distribution of these two groups looks sufficiently different
            to me that I wish to examine them further. In order to determine how likely
            it is that the age at first pregnancy is altered by birth control education,
            I put forward the following hypothesis: the differences in the distributions
            of age at first conception between the groups "birth control ed" and "no
            birth control ed" (shown in the previous section, Fig. 1) are a result
            of the type of sex ed that the groups received. Given that a woman has
            had birth control ed, it is likely that she will have a first pregnancy
            later than a woman who has not had birth control ed. The null hypothesis:
            the difference between the two groups (birth control ed, and no birth control
            ed) was purely chance. The p-value of the null hypothesis is 0.001. This
            indicates that the null hypothesis is unlikely, and that the difference
            in distributions is statistically significant.

        <p>
            I observed that the mean first pregnancy age for abstinence only education
            was close to the mean for all women. In order to quantify the statistical
            significance of abstinence only education, I ran a Monte Carlo simulation
            to see what the distribution in differences in means between abstinence
            only education and all women is, and computed the p-value for the null
            hypothesis (the difference between the distribution of ages of first pregnancy
            for women who had abstinence only education and the distribution of ages
            of first pregnancy for all women is purely coincidental). The p-value was
            0.991. In other words, it the observed effect of abstinence only education
            is statistically insignificant.

            I plotted the distribution of the age of first conception vs the standard

            It makes sense that the distribution of ages at first conception would
            be normal because the age at first conception is most likely the combination
            of many factors, such as demographics, family life, and education. The
            ages that were recorded in the dataset are the result of a sum of all these
            factors. I would like to poke around and try to find some of these other
            factors. In the next section, I will examine <em>income</em>.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Up until the last section, I've assumed that age at first conception is
            influenced only by sex ed. Now I've also observed that it can be modeled
            by a normal distribution, and that there are probably many factors that
            influence it. Income is a logical variable to investigate, because it tends
            to be correlated with everything.<sup><a href="#downey">[5]</a></sup>

        <p>
            To examine the relationship between income and age at first conception,
            I created a scatter plot of log(income) vs age at first conception, Fig.
            3. I jittered the log(income) data by 0.2 because income was grouped in
            bins on the survey, and I wanted to be able to see the pattern more clearly.

            Fig 3. There seems to be a potential weak correlation between log(income)
            and age at first conception, with the lowest income bracket being an outlier.

            In order to find the linear regression that matched the scatter plot,
            I found the parameters for <span class="equation">&#x0233; = &#x03b1; + &#x03b2;x&#x0304;</span> to be  <span class="equation">&#x03b1; = 0.40816</span> and <span class="equation">&#x03b2; = 17.6262</span>.

        <p>
            Computing the correlation between log(income) and age at first conception,
            I get 0.1471. This is not a strong correlation, but it warrants further
            investigation, considering I have ignored income in my calculations thus
            far.

        <h3>
            Multiple linear regression to account for income
        </h3>
        <p>
            The age at first conception probably depends on multiple factors, and
            by modeling it only in terms of whether or not a woman had birth control
            education, I am ignoring the potential correlation between income and birth
            control education. It is possible, for example, that women from lower income
            families have a lower likelihood of having birth control education than
            those from higher income families, and that women from lower income families
            also have a higher likelihood of becoming pregnant at an earlier age due
            to other factors. In order to insure that birth control education actually
            does cause the observed correlation between it and age at first conception,
            I need to find the link between income, birth control education, and age
            at first conception.

            to the natural log of the income of the woman's family.

            With all three variables, both income and bc taken into account, the effect
            of bc smaller than when only bc is taken into account, and also less statistically
            significant, however bc does not change enough to warrant throwing it out.
            It is still statistically significant, with a p-value of around 0.001 no
            matter whether or not income is taken into account. Women who have birth
            control education are likely to get pregnant later than women who have
            no birth control education, and women whose families have higher incomes
            are also likely to get pregnant later than women who have lower income
            families.

            Oversampling in the NSFG
        </h3>
        <p>
            The NSFG survey oversampled Blacks, Hispanics and women ages 15-24.<sup><a href="#NSFG_guide">[4]</a></sup> I
            am only studying women ages 15-24, so the oversampling for young women
            doesn't need to be taken into account; I simply will not be able to predict
            anything for women over 24 and do not attempt to do so. In order to make
            predictions based on my data for all young women in the US, however, I
            would need to account for the oversampling of Blacks and Hispanics by using
            Bayesian estimation. I would need to find the correlation between race
            and age of first pregnancy, and then change my distribution according to
            the actual fraction of each race in the US, as compared to the fraction
            of each race as represented by the data. In the interests of time, I have
            not corrected for oversampling.

            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            There is a correlation between birth control ed and age at first conception.
            Even when income is taken into account, the p-value of the null hypothesis
            (the differences in the distribution of ages of first conception is due
            to chance) is close to 0.001. In other words, given the evidence that a
            woman has had birth control education, her first pregnancy has a likelihood
            of coming after that of another woman who has not had birth control education.
            In addition, the effect of abstinence only education on age at first conception
            was proven to be statistically insignificant (p-value 0.991). All types
            of sex education had statistically insignificant effects on wantedness
            and number of pregnancies.
