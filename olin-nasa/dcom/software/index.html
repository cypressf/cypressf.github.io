            <p>Because the nature of our project was to create a demonstration of the x-ray communication technology, we
                wanted an interface that easily allows people to send and receive data via RS232. We considered using
                proprietary software, but eventually decided to program this interface from the ground up, because we
                needed the ability to easily debug the signal, and have precision control over what the computer was
                sending. We tried to start with the simplest transmission we could get, and incrementally increase the
                complexity of the transmissions, squishing bugs when we came to them one at a time, as opposed to
                shooting directly for a lofty goal and trying to debug everything at once. Thus, we created...</p>

                <h2>Custom digital communication</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern digital communication protocols can be quite complex because data is easily lost&mdash;out of
                    the billions of bits that are sent, it is likely that some will be read incorrectly, which creates
                    the need for elaborate
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_control">error control</a>
                    and complicated
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshaking</a>
                    . These digital protocols, while making the connection between computers more robust, can impede our
                    ability to control and understand the signals at the bit-level.
                </p>
                <img src="../simple_connection.png" class="right">

                <p> In order to have complete control over the signals we transmit, we created a simple digital
                    communication protocol by programming two microcontrollers to talk to each other without any error
                    control. We used three wires to connect them, which we refer to as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>High</li>
                    <li>Low</li>
                    <li>Confirm</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This protocol was unidirectional. A single bit was sent in 5 stages.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Microcontroller A raises voltage on the
                        <em>high</em>
                        pin
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Microcontroller B sees that this voltage has been raised, and responds by raising the
                        <em>confirm</em>
                        pin.
                    </li>
                    <li>A sees the confirm pin has been raised, and responds by lowering the high pin</li>
                    <li>B sees that the voltage has been lowered once again, and responds by lowering the confirm pin.
                    </li>
                    <li>A sees that the confirm pin has been lowered, and thus decides it is safe to send another bit
                        (repeat from beginning)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The same process can be used to send a
                    <em>low</em>
                    bit. The high and low bits correspond to 1s and 0s. It functions irrespective of speed of
                    transmission. Even if a single signal takes ten years to reach microcontoller B, microcontroller A
                    will wait for the confirmation signal before it proceeds. In this way, we insure that the signal can
                    survive being sent x-ray transmission, because we are unsure of the signal delay we will have

                <p>
                    We used the built in
                    <abbr title="Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter">UART</abbr>
                    in the microcontrollers we were using to send serial data to another microcontroller. This was
                    extremely easy to set up due to the
                    <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">Arduino microcontroller libraries</a>
                    . We simply hooked the transmit pin of one microcontroller to the receive pin of another and were
                    able to send bytes of data at a specified baud rate using the
                    <code>Serial.write()</code>
                    and
                    <code>Serial.read()</code>
                    functions. This approach was used as a proof of concept: we could transmit data (in the RS232
                    protocol) via a microcontroller.

                <h2>RS232 signal between microcontroller and computer</h2>
                <p>It was slightly more difficult on the hardware side to achieve a connection between the
                    microcontroller and the computer, because the output voltages of the microcontroller were not within
                    the RS232 range and had to be inverted and amplified with a MAX232 chip before fed into the
                    computer.</p>
                <p>
                    It was also more difficult on the software side. We knew that the microcontroller could send a
                    signal, but we didn't know how to receive it on the computer. Because RS232 is a protocol
                    established in 1962, it is deeply rooted in Unix. The settings for transmissions between computers
                    running a Unix based system were originally controlled using the
                    <code>
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stty">stty</a>
                    </code>
                    command. The computer must know what baud rate to use, which characters indicate the end of a line
                    or a file, etc. and in order to communicate with another computer, these settings must match up. We
                    established base settings to always use on our devices. In addition, we used a Unix shell to receive
                    data from the microcontroller by running
                    <code>cat /dev/ttyS0</code>
                    , which output the characters coming in to the serial port to the shell display.

                    <code>echo A &gt; /dev/ttyS0</code>

                    File transfer proved easy because
                    <code>minicom</code>
                    directly interfaces with common file transfer protocols. We used the

                File transfer speeds were fast enough to transfer an image, but too slow to transfer a 70 MB file within
