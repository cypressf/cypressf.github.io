            <p>Since we've recieved the MXS in the mail, our team has faced many ups and downs. I'll go with the bad
                news first. The MXS has a problem that the power source for the
                detector, unless it is turned on its side (which is our fix for now), produces an odd sine wave with the
                pulses in that sine wave. Our team is concerned that if we make
                a system that works when the detector power source is turned on its side, it won't be applicable to
                other situations. Also, we're still struggeling to get our peak and
                hold circuit to work, but we are definitely making progress. We also discovered a flaw in the LED driver
                circuit, causing there to be a need for a PCB reorder.
                The last piece of bad news is that we're running out of time. We're looking for possible deliverable
                solutions if we don't get this MXS output circuit completed.</p>
            <p>On a more positive note we were able, just yesterday, to send a for loop of 'a's through one computer,
                through the MXS, to the second computer. We recieved
                "?aayx?c:a@?aa?a42a??aP_1a?aa?eT%a" as a result through the chat client, which is awesome! We're sending
                a signal through the MXS and having it sucessfully trasmit
                about 50% of the correct characters we send it. We're also trying out some different circuits: peak and
                hold with a diode instead of a transistor, a monostable
                multivibrator, and making our own schmitt trigger so we can contol the threshold values. We have also
                designed ordered a new PCB (it looks pretty darn good if I do say
                so myself). We've also made sure that the PCB will fit nicely into the box that we have bought for it.
            </p>
            <p>Today, we also completed construction of a 'proof-of-concept' structure where we transmit signals from
                the first computer to a red LED to a photodiode to the second
                computer. We sucessfully were able to chat using the chat client. So even if we do not have the MXS
                output circuit finished, we can at least show that we have everything
                else working. </p>

            <p>Today has been very exciting. The most thrilling thing to happen is that we recieved the replacement MXS
                in the mail!! Woot!!! We have begun testing with it, it's
                looking promising!! Sasha and Sarah also gave the Olin College Brownbag Lunch Presentation today, our
                team thinks that it went well. We even recieved some feedback
                from a fellow student that we plan on adding to our final report as another idea for future ideas for
                how to make the digital transmission system better.</p>
            <p>Back to the MXS testing, as shown below the MXS is giving us a reasonable + and - output.</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, Jessica and Sarah did some circuitry analysis on the Schmitt trigger. They constructed
                a simple circuit to convert a -5 to 5 V signal to a 0 to 5 V
                signal, and also can turn any signal centered at 0 to a -5 to 5 volt signal. So our team now has the
                ability to turn any signal centered at 0 into a signal the Schmitt
                trigger will recieve as an input. Sasha also did some work this weekend. Unfortunately, she discovered
                that the MXS is no longer working like it used to. On Monday,
                Keith confirmed that the vacuum seal of the MXS is broken and is sending us a new MXS.</p>
            <p>Since we couldn't do any testing with the MXS today, Jessica worked on the website and ordered solderless
                breadboards, components, and boxes for our final circuit deliverables.
                Sarah worked on documentation and the upcoming Midsummer Lunch Presentation. Cypress worked on changing
                the software to have a higher overall bandwidth. He also worked
                with Sasha on preparing our circuits as best they could for testing on the MXS, which should hopefully
                arrive tomorrow!</p>

            <p>Yesterday, we recieved a lot of help from Professor Brad Minch (fun fact: has the same birthday as one of
                our team-members: Sarah Strohkorb). He suggested that we
                build a peak and hold detector. He thought that this would allow us to have square-wave looking signals
                at both 55 and 5.5 kHz. For the past two days our team has
                furiously been looking into how they work and how to make them work for the frequencies that we desire.

            </div>
            <p>We found that changing the capacitor and resistor values alters the fall time after a peak is detected
                and held. We also discovered that using an op-amp with a
                higher slew rate increases the range of higher frequencies we can use the peak and hold detector for
                now. Right now, with the results that we have (figure below)
                we're hoping to make the 5.5 kHz signal look more like the 55 kHz signal. But our team is unsure at the
                moment if this peak and hold detector will work for such a
                large frequency range.</p>

            <p>
                Today, we found that using the RMS chip could definitely be useful. The RMS chip takes the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square">root mean square</a>
                of the signal coming out of the MXS. This helps us detect a signal, even when it tends to drift to zero
                (see the leftmost graph below). The RMS chip basically multiplies the signal by itself, to get a
                positive voltage output, then takes the square root and averages the result. By doing so, any large AC
                wave is converted into a near constant high voltage, while any small amplitude AC wave is converted into
                a small amplitude voltage.

            <p>After our success yesterday, of course we would come up with some problems... We found that we could not
                add an amplifier after
                the filter, it made the signal look completely different, smaller, and just overall odd. In order to
                attempt to isolate each
                component of the system, we added a voltage follower using a TL081 op-amp after every component
                (amplifiers, filters) which cleared
                up our problem of being unable to alter the output of the filter signal. We also discovered a new
                problem. Until now, we have only been concerned
                with 50 kHz frequency signals, but in reality we will be dealing with pulses that are larger than 50 kHz
                square wave input signals to
                the MXS. The following figure shows the difference of what our circuitry can do for 50 kHz and a 5 kHz
                input frequencies.</p>

            <div class="center">

                            50 kHz square wave, not a 5 kHz square
                            wave.</figcaption>

            </div>

            <p>In order to be able to have the MXS transmit both frequencies cleanly, we're going to have to search for
                a new approach, possibly
                root mean square. </p>

            <p>Today has been very productive. We think that we're very close to achieving a clean output signal. First
                of all, we believe
                that we have solved our filter problem! It's at least looking like our filter is filtering now:</p>

            <div class="center">
                <figure>
                    <image class="center" src="../Before_and_after.jpg" width="700">
                        <figcaption style="width:700px">These scope outputs display a signal before and after being put
                            into the third order Sallen-Key
                            low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of about 270 kHz.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>


            Including amplification and filtering, our signal now looks like the following:

            <div class="center">
                <figure>
                    <image class="center" src="../After_filter02.jpg" width="500">
                        <figcaption style="width:500px">This image displays the very clean input signal to the MXS and
                            the output signal that we have
                            amplified and filtered.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>


            Now, we need to amplify the output of our amplifier and filter and center the signal so that it is a 0 to 5
            V square wave.

            Our other breakthrough today is we cleaned up the MXS output signal by using the MXS differential output,
            and sending both signals
            through an Instrumental Amplifier, as pictured below, we were able to achieve a cleaner output that we used
            to get the results that
            you see above.

            <div class="center">

                </figure>
            </div>


            We also finalized our design for our PCB for the current amplifier.

            <div class="center">

                </figure>
            </div>


            We now just need to order connector parts for this PCB, actually order it, and possibly make a box for it,
            and we'll be good to go

            <p>At our team meeting today, we decided that it would be best for our entire team to focus on the MXS
                signal clean-up
                circuit until it gets completed. We also decided to more specifically document every circuit that we
                test by making circuit
                diagrams in LTSpice, labeling the circuits themselves, and taking oscilloscope screen shots when we test
                them. Cypress
                started a software manual for the MXS digital communication demonstration for a live chat and file
                transfer. Our team is
                confident that we will be able to complete both demonstrations becasue we've tested that it works for a
                computer to MAX-232
                to MAX-232 to computer system. All we need to do to complete the demonstration is put our two circuits
                and MXS into the middle
                which are not possible yet due to the hold up with the post-MXS ciruit. As far as the post-MXS circuit
                today, we made progress
                in diagnosing the filter problems and with the RMS chip we purchased and are considering using. With the
                filter, we tested that
                the MXS signal does pass through the filter, but the filter does not actually visually 'filter' the
                signal as you can see below.</p>

            <div class="center">
                <figure>

                        <figcaption style="width:700px">These three oscilloscope pictures display what the input and
                            output signals look like for the
                            Sallen-Key low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 2.7 MHz for the frequencies of 365kHz,
                            2.64MHz, and 5.33MHz. We see behavior
                            that we would expect for a filter, the signal become less recognisable and smaller in
                            voltage amplitude as the frequency goes near
                            and above the cutoff frequency.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>The problem with the filter is that it doesn't do what we had hoped. We were hoping that the filter would
                get rid of the fuzziness
                of the pulses. We noticed a 40MHz noise when we averaged a pulse signal, so we were thinking that the
                filter would get rid of that
                noise, but lo and behold, it's still here.</p>

            <div class="center">
                <figure>
                    <image class="center" src="../MXS_Filter_Output4.jpg" width="400">
                        <figcaption style="width:400px">This image displays the averaged 40MHz noise that I'm talking
                            about above. Where does it come from?
                            I don't know.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>What's also interesting is that there is no 40MHz signal that comes up when we do a FFT on the
                oscilloscope. In addition to the
                filter analysis we did today, we also looked into using a RMS chip to have the MXS signal have a minimum
                of zero by taking its
                absolute value as you can see below.</p>

            <div class="center">
                <figure>
                    <image class="center" src="../RMS-trial1.png" width="400">
                        <figcaption style="width:400px">This image shows what the RMS chip can do: take the absolute
                            value the input signal.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Unfortunately, we have not been sucessful with using the RMS chip with the MXS. We think that the problem
                lies with the RMS chip
                not being made to work with high frequency signals. </p>

            <p>The past two days have been interesting. Yesterday, our team put together a system on one breadboard. The
                system
                included two inverting amplifiers using the AD848s (op-amp high gain bandwith product), the 3rd order
                Sallen-Key
                low-pass filter, the envelope detector, then the Schmitt trigger. Unfortunately, the filter was not
                working with the MXS.
                When we tested it out with a function generator and oscilloscope, it displayed the appropriate filtering
                behavior,
                but with the MXS, it displayed an output signal at 5V. Interesting... Today, we've been trying different
                approaches:
                looking at transistor logic, RMS chips, and the system we currently have. Our team feels like they've
                hit somewhat
                of a roadblock. We hope to find a way to clean up this signal soon. While not working on the circuit on
                the output
                of the MXS, we also designed a PCB design for our current and voltage control for the LED control on the
                front-end
                of the MXS. It's looking awesome.</p>

            <p>Right now, our critical path is the circuit that is cleaning up the signal after the MXS and making it
                look
                like the input digital signal. Thankfully, we solved our op-amp problem. Now we know that we must use a
                minimum
                gain of 5 for them. We also were able to make the signal from the MXS output to not go below 0, using an
                envelope
                detector. Unfortunately, our filter does not actually do anything right now because we set it to have a
                cutoff
                frequency that is too high. Tomorrow we will work on lowering the cutoff frequency of the filter and
                using a non-
                inverting amplifier instead of an inverting amplifier. Thanks so much to Dr. Siddhartan Govindasamy!! He
                gave us
                some extremely useful tips today.</p>

            <p>Today has been slightly more mellow than most, maybe that's because our team gets distracted slightly by
                Google+... who knows? But today definitly has been productive. Exciting: we now have the capabilities of
                sending
                files via RS-232! Good work Cypress!! We also discovered that the reason that our op-amps
                were acting kinda odd is because the resistors that we used had resistance values that were too high and
                we
                only today discovered the suggested inverting amplifier on the op-amp's datasheet for some other circuit
                schematic options. Our only new problem is that we discovered that our current and voltage control
                circuit for the
                LED needs some redesign due to the varying input voltages that it needs to be capable of recieving.
                Jessica and I
                additionally discovered that it would take 200V to kill a person, from finding out that it takes .2A to
                stop the heart
                and the resistance of the human body (about 1k ohm). Yay Ohm's Law!</p>

            <p>We recieved the op-amps and low capacitance capacitors in the mail today!! Yay!! With these, we started
                construction on our two current ideas for low-pass filters and testing of the amplifier, using 4 of the
                op-amps we got today. The day was filled with highs and lows, at least for me. The amplifier ended up
                giving
                one of the oddest clean but messy signal that we still haven't figured out. One of the filters works,
                which
                is exciting, it's just centered at -12V, so we need to figure out what's up with that. The other filter
                has
                yet to be tested, but will be soon. It's such a relief to know that the filter is working at least, and
                by
                working I mean making the signal look much cleaner (forgetting the centering issue). Hopefully all of
                our
                other problems will be worked out soon.</p>

            <p>Today, our team has been furiously making updates to the website, which is looking quite good if I don't
                say so myself. We have ordered capacitors for the two low pass filters that we're going to try in order
                to transform the MXS output signal to a square wave that can be red by a computer. We should get them
                before
                the weekend comes since we chose to get overnight UPS shipping. We also have started designing the PCB
                for
                our current and voltage control for the LED input into the MXS circuit. On an somewhat unrelated note,
                the
                weekly BBQ lunch was quite tasty, but not as amusing as the boys playing 'bumper cars' in the lab.</p>

            <p>We're starting daily updates, effective today! Our team has gone through quite the change of plans from
                our beginning goals of sending video through the MXS using USB ports and cables. As of now, we have a
                computer to computer chat demo ready on the software side and a current and voltage LED driver circuit
                controlling the input to the MXS. We're working on constructing the circuit on the output of the MXS. We
                have an amplifier and a schmitt trigger, and are looking to build a low pass filter that will have a
                cutoff frequency of 27ish MHz. We talked to both Brad and Oscar today. They gave us suggestions for
                our filters and how to better transfer the signal from the MXS to a breadboard or circuit. Also, today
                our website is making some great progress!</p>

            <p>Before we started our daily updates, we went through several different changes to our goal and
                implementation. The purpose of this entry is to summarize the events leading up to June 28 (the date of
                our first update).</p>

            <p>Initially, we intended to use the MXS to stream video through X-ray communication. But we soon realized
                that such an ambitious task was out of the scope of our project, so we revised our goal. We toyed with
                the idea of using Ethernet or some other protocol to send digital data, but ultimately we settled on
                using RS232 to make an X-ray chat client or transmit files digitally via X-ray.</p>

            <p>Even after establishing our goal, however, we ran into numerous problems that resulted in changes to our
                circuitry. For example, we built our first amplifier out of discrete components, believing it would give
                us the most flexibility in dealing with high-frequency signals. After consulting with professors (our
                usual inspiration for changing our plans) we decided to use an operational amplifier to simplify the
                circuit - as it turns out, all we have to do is get faster op-amps and the frequency won't really be a
                concern. For reference, our original amplifier circuit is shown below.</p>

            <div class="center">
                <figure>
                    <image class="center" src="../TransistorAmplifier.png">
                        <figcaption style="width:700px">Amplifier built out of discrete components; no longer intended
                            for use.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>Another of our early tests combined an amplifier with a Schmitt trigger. That test first suggested to us
                that using a low-pass filter might be worthwhile after we got the following results:</p>

            <div class="center">
                <figure>
                    <image class="center" src="../No_filter.png" height="300">
                        <figcaption style="width:350px">By using an amplifier and Schmitt trigger on the signal output
                            of the MXS, we achieved the results shown above, the raw MXS output
                            signal in dark blue and the amplified and Schmitt triggered signal in light blue.
                            Unfortunately, the square waves are not whole square waves and still have some
                            noise.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p>After showing these results to a few Olin professors, they suggested that we look into a low-pass filter.
                We then decided to try a Sallen-Key third order low-pass
                filter. Sallen-Key third order low-pass filters average the effects of a first order low-pass fileter
                with a lower than desired cutoff frequency and a second order
                low-pass filter with a higher than desired cutoff frequency. This effect is a sharp dropoff in output
                voltage to input voltage right around the desired cutoff frequency
                as shown in the figure below.</p>

                            Sallen-Key low-pass filter works. It is the average of a first order low-pass filter
                            with a lower cutoff frequency and a second order low-pass filter with a higher cutoff
                            frequency. The circuit diagram on the right is the circuit schematic for this
                            filter.</figcaption>
