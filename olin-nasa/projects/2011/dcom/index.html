        <h1>Statement of Work</h1>
        <p>
          We will couple a high speed digital RS232 communication infrastructure
          to the MXS transceiver. Our system will drive a 255 nm UV LED with 20
          mA (and the capability of driving 10 parallel LEDs with 200 mA), and
          will filter and amplify the output of the x-ray transceiver.

        <h1>Overview of Project</h1>
        <h2>Wired RS232</h2>
        <p>
          Wired digital communication between two devices has been possible for
          a while. For example, the RS232 standard originated in 1962. RS232
          uses two unidirectional lines (transmit and receive) to transfer data.
          Below we can see two computers communicating via RS232. Device "A"
          sends data along one line to device "B," while device "B" sends data
          along another line to device "A."
        </p>
        <img src="diagram1.png" class="png" />

        <h2>Clipping the wires</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to snip the RS232 line in half, and bridge the gap with a
          wireless x-ray transceiver. In the following diagram you can see that
          two unidirectional x-ray transceivers have been inserted in between
          the RS232 wires.
        </p>
        <img src="diagram2.png" class="png" />

        <h2>But we only have one transceiver</h2>
        <p>
          We are currently limited by hardware to transmitting wirelessly in one
          direction, thus we must use the transceiver to transmit data from
          computer "A" to computer "B," but use a wired link to transmit back
          the other way
        </p>
        <img src="diagram3.png" class="png" />

        <h2>Let's take a closer look</h2>
        <p>
          There are two main circuits needed: a transmitter and a receiver. The
          transmitter circuit needs to take a wired input, and output an x-ray
          signal. The receiver circuit must take an x-ray signal input, and
          output a voltage to a wire.
        </p>
        <img src="diagram4.png" class="png" />

        <h2>Transmitter circuit</h2>
        <p>
          The input voltage to the transmitter must be converted into a signal
          capable of driving an LED, which, through the photoelectric effect,
          will drive an electron beam which will create x-rays when it hits a
          target. To convert the wired input signal from RS232 to something
          capable of driving a specific LED, an amplifier is needed to ensure it
          outputs the correct current.
        </p>
        <img src="diagram5.png" class="png" />

        <h2>Receiver circuit</h2>
        <p>
          The X-ray receiver (already built) takes an x-ray signal and outputs a
          voltage. Due to the nature of the receiver, this output voltage is
          very weak (on the order of 50 mV) and noisy, so it must be converted
          into a clean, strong signal before it is sent back to an RS232 device.
